    "# Product Insight Validation Using LLMs: Copilot Recommendationsüîç\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebooks aims to evaluate different prompting strategies and prompts for validating Copilot Recommendations using a Large Language Model (LLM). The goal is to have a sandbox where we can fine-tune prompts using the same cross validation sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compare Prompting Strategies:** Test multiple prompts and strategies to determine which yields the best classification results.\n",
    "- **Evaluate Performance:** Measure the effectiveness of each strategy using precision, recall, and F1 score.\n",
    "- **Cross-Validation Approach:** Utilize a labeled dataset containing:\n",
    "  - **True Positives (TP):** Correctly identified valid insights.\n",
    "  - **True Negatives (TN):** Correctly identified invalid insights.\n",
    "  - **False Positives (FP):** Incorrectly marked invalid insights as valid.\n",
    "  - **False Negatives (FN):** Incorrectly marked valid insights as invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load Product Insights**  \n",
    "   - Import CSV files containing business goals for validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Apply LLM-Based Validation**  \n",
    "   - Building blocks for using LLM to validate, and cleaning inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluate Performance**  \n",
    "   - Compute precision, recall, and F1 score to assess classification accuracy.\n",
    "   - Compare the effectiveness of different strategies based on their performance metrics.\n",
    "   - 3.1 Zero Shot Prompting\n",
    "   - 3.2 Few Shot Prompting\n",
    "   - 3.3 Multi-pass w/ Few Shot prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optimize for Accuracy**  \n",
    "   - Identify the best-performing prompt and strategy for product insight validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tech Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLM Provider:** Azure OpenAI  \n",
    "- **Model:** ChatGPT 4.0  \n",
    "- **Data Processing:** Python (pandas, numpy)  \n",
    "- **Evaluation Metrics:** precision, recall, F1 score  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "- A clear understanding of which prompting strategy yields the best results.\n",
    "- A methodology/workflow that can be iteratively improved and scaled for future product insight validation tasks.\n",

    "\n",
    "  - **Aligns with Needs/Goals:** It clearly connects a Copilot feature or capability with the customer's stated **business needs or goals**. (e.g., ‚ÄúUsing Copilot in Excel will help you analyze these sales figures faster so you can meet your deadline.‚Äù)\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Provides Value-Add Insight:** It goes beyond the original support issue to offer something extra that contributes to the customer‚Äôs success. The ambassador demonstrates an understanding of the customer's context and gives a relevant, helpful suggestion.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Hands-On or Clearly Described:** A strong recommendation either demonstrates the Copilot feature or clearly describes how it works and what benefit it brings to the customer. A live demo is ideal, but not required if the explanation is vivid and practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Tailored to Use Case (Flexible):** The suggestion should ideally reference the customer‚Äôs specific scenario or pain point. However, clear and helpful recommendations that are relevant to common Microsoft 365 usage scenarios may still be considered valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Copilot Mention (Flexible):** If the recommendation clearly describes a capability associated with Copilot (e.g. summarizing emails, drafting responses, generating insights), it can be valid even if the word \"Copilot\" is not mentioned‚Äîprovided the feature is accurately described.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Context and Impact:** The recommendation should help the customer understand when and why they might use the feature. Mentioning expected benefits (e.g. saving time, improving accuracy, reducing effort) is sufficient ‚Äî precise metrics are not required.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the recommendation is vague, generic, not aligned with a business goal or customer need, fails to explain the benefit of the feature, or sounds like a template without personalization ‚Äî it should be marked **Invalid**.\n",

    "**What does a great Copilot Value Add look like?**  \n",
    "It‚Äôs **customer-centric**: The ambassador (support agent) clearly links a Copilot feature to a **specific business benefit** for that customer. It demonstrates how using Copilot will contribute to the customer‚Äôs business or personal objectives (e.g., saving time, improving accuracy, boosting team collaboration). It also usually involves **showing Copilot in action** (like giving a quick demo or guiding the customer through using Copilot right there, so they experience its value first-hand). Throughout, it‚Äôs **tailored to the customer‚Äôs use case**: it addresses the customer‚Äôs own pain points and workflows, with context about their environment, rather than being a generic pitch. In short, a valid value-add recommendation feels like helpful coaching or insight, not a sales script.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an ambassador is an external consultant working on behalf of the customer, or if the recommendation is part of a promotional campaign, it‚Äôs still crucial that they **define a relevant use case** so the customer can see the practical value. (For example, instead of just saying ‚ÄúTry Copilot‚Äôs new feature X!‚Äù, they should say something like ‚ÄúSince you often have to do Y, Copilot‚Äôs feature X could save you Z hours by...‚Äù). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Validation Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "To mark the entry **Valid**, ensure the conversation‚Äôs recommendation:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Aligns with Needs/Goals:** It explicitly connects a Copilot feature or capability with the customer‚Äôs stated **business needs or goals**. (Does it say *which* Copilot feature, and *how* it helps the customer reach their goal or solve a problem? e.g. ‚ÄúUsing Copilot in Excel will help you analyze these sales figures 10x faster, so you can make your quarterly report deadline.‚Äù)\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Provides Value-Add Insight:** It goes beyond the original support issue‚Äôs resolution to offer something extra. The ambassador is clearly focused on the customer‚Äôs broader success: they show they **understand the customer‚Äôs business/technical context** and give a suggestion that genuinely benefits the customer or their business (not just pushing a random feature). It should feel like they‚Äôre building a relationship or trust, not just closing a ticket.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Hands-On Interaction:** Whenever possible, the ambassador actually **demonstrates or walks the customer through the Copilot feature** in real-time. (For example, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have Copilot draft an email for you right now so you see how it works.‚Äù) This tangible experience helps the customer immediately grasp the feature‚Äôs value. *(If a live demo isn‚Äôt possible, at least the conversation should vividly describe how to use the feature or what it would do for them.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Tailored to the Use Case:** The suggestion is not one-size-fits-all; it‚Äôs personalized. It references the customer‚Äôs unique scenario, data, or pain point and shows **how Copilot addresses that specific situation**. (It should sound like, ‚ÄúGiven you mentioned [pain point/need], Copilot can [specific solution].‚Äù If it‚Äôs generic or irrelevant to what the customer cares about, that‚Äôs not good.)\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Context and Impact:** It provides enough context about the feature and how it will fit into or improve the customer‚Äôs **workflow or satisfaction**. It might mention how it would save time in their daily routine, reduce errors in their process, improve their team‚Äôs communication, etc. The customer should be able to imagine exactly when and why they‚Äôd use Copilot from this explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If any of these elements are missing (e.g. the ambassador just says ‚ÄúTry Copilot, it‚Äôs cool!‚Äù without context, or suggests a feature that doesn‚Äôt match the customer‚Äôs goals), then the recommendation is **Invalid**. Also, if the ambassador fails to show or explain the feature, or the customer is left confused about why they‚Äôd use it, that‚Äôs not a successful value-add.\n",
    "\n",
    "###EXAMPLES\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1 (Valid):\n",
    "Conversation excerpt: After resolving a Teams call quality issue, the ambassador says: ‚ÄúSince you run many large meetings, have you tried Copilot in Teams? It can generate a quick summary of your meetings and highlight action items. For instance, in your last all-hands, Copilot could have pulled out the three next steps everyone agreed on ‚Äì saving you the time of writing up notes. Shall I show you how to do that?‚Äù They then walk the customer through using Teams Copilot to summarize a recent meeting recording, and the customer reacts positively.\n",
    "Analysis: The ambassador specifically links a Copilot feature (Teams meeting summaries) to the customer‚Äôs goal (not having to manually summarize large meetings). They provided a hands-on demonstration (‚ÄúShall I show you‚Ä¶‚Äù) and clearly tailored it to the customer‚Äôs scenario (their last all-hands meeting). The value (time saved, clearer action items) was explicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2 (Invalid):\n",
    "Conversation excerpt: The support issue was about a SharePoint file permission error, which the ambassador fixed. Then the ambassador adds: ‚ÄúBy the way, you should check out Copilot ‚Äì it‚Äôs awesome. It can do a lot of cool things with your data!‚Äù The customer asks if it can help with file permissions, and the ambassador just says, ‚ÄúNot exactly, but it‚Äôs still worth exploring. Lots of our clients love it.‚Äù The customer murmurs ‚Äúokay‚Ä¶,‚Äù sounding uncertain, and the call ends.\n",
    "Analysis: This recommendation is vague and not tied to the customer‚Äôs issue or goals. The ambassador didn‚Äôt specify any feature (just ‚ÄúCopilot‚Äù broadly) or show how it would actually help this customer. There was no demonstration or concrete example relevant to the customer‚Äôs context (file management). It comes off as a superficial pitch. From a PLG perspective, it‚Äôs not useful ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt educate or excite the user, so it likely won‚Äôt drive adoption.\n",
