    "# Product Insight Validation Using LLMs: M365 Recommendationsüîç\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebooks aims to evaluate different prompting strategies and prompts for validating M365 Recommendations using a Large Language Model (LLM). The goal is to have a sandbox where we can fine-tune prompts using the same cross validation sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compare Prompting Strategies:** Test multiple prompts and strategies to determine which yields the best classification results.\n",
    "- **Evaluate Performance:** Measure the effectiveness of each strategy using precision, recall, and F1 score.\n",
    "- **Cross-Validation Approach:** Utilize a labeled dataset containing:\n",
    "  - **True Positives (TP):** Correctly identified valid insights.\n",
    "  - **True Negatives (TN):** Correctly identified invalid insights.\n",
    "  - **False Positives (FP):** Incorrectly marked invalid insights as valid.\n",
    "  - **False Negatives (FN):** Incorrectly marked valid insights as invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load Product Insights**  \n",
    "   - Import CSV files containing business goals for validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Apply LLM-Based Validation**  \n",
    "   - Building blocks for using LLM to validate, and cleaning inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluate Performance**  \n",
    "   - Compute precision, recall, and F1 score to assess classification accuracy.\n",
    "   - Compare the effectiveness of different strategies based on their performance metrics.\n",
    "   - 3.1 Zero Shot Prompting\n",
    "   - 3.2 Few Shot Prompting\n",
    "   - 3.3 Multi-pass w/ Few Shot prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optimize for Accuracy**  \n",
    "   - Identify the best-performing prompt and strategy for product insight validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tech Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLM Provider:** Azure OpenAI  \n",
    "- **Model:** ChatGPT 4.0  \n",
    "- **Data Processing:** Python (pandas, numpy)  \n",
    "- **Evaluation Metrics:** precision, recall, F1 score  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "- A clear understanding of which prompting strategy yields the best results.\n",
    "- A methodology/workflow that can be iteratively improved and scaled for future product insight validation tasks.\n",
