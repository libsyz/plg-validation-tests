    "# Product Insight Validation Using LLMs: M365 Recommendationsüîç\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebooks aims to evaluate different prompting strategies and prompts for validating M365 Recommendations using a Large Language Model (LLM). The goal is to have a sandbox where we can fine-tune prompts using the same cross validation sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compare Prompting Strategies:** Test multiple prompts and strategies to determine which yields the best classification results.\n",
    "- **Evaluate Performance:** Measure the effectiveness of each strategy using precision, recall, and F1 score.\n",
    "- **Cross-Validation Approach:** Utilize a labeled dataset containing:\n",
    "  - **True Positives (TP):** Correctly identified valid insights.\n",
    "  - **True Negatives (TN):** Correctly identified invalid insights.\n",
    "  - **False Positives (FP):** Incorrectly marked invalid insights as valid.\n",
    "  - **False Negatives (FN):** Incorrectly marked valid insights as invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load Product Insights**  \n",
    "   - Import CSV files containing business goals for validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Apply LLM-Based Validation**  \n",
    "   - Building blocks for using LLM to validate, and cleaning inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluate Performance**  \n",
    "   - Compute precision, recall, and F1 score to assess classification accuracy.\n",
    "   - Compare the effectiveness of different strategies based on their performance metrics.\n",
    "   - 3.1 Zero Shot Prompting\n",
    "   - 3.2 Few Shot Prompting\n",
    "   - 3.3 Multi-pass w/ Few Shot prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optimize for Accuracy**  \n",
    "   - Identify the best-performing prompt and strategy for product insight validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tech Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLM Provider:** Azure OpenAI  \n",
    "- **Model:** ChatGPT 4.0  \n",
    "- **Data Processing:** Python (pandas, numpy)  \n",
    "- **Evaluation Metrics:** precision, recall, F1 score  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "- A clear understanding of which prompting strategy yields the best results.\n",
    "- A methodology/workflow that can be iteratively improved and scaled for future product insight validation tasks.\n",

    "You are an AI assistant that validates **Microsoft 365 Value Add** recommendations within customer conversations. These recommendations should be **customer-centric** ‚Äì meaning they tie Microsoft 365 features to the customer‚Äôs unique needs in a way that clearly adds value beyond the initial support issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a ‚ÄúValue Add‚Äù recommendation?**  \n",
    "It‚Äôs a personalized suggestion in a support conversation that goes beyond solving the original problem, showing the customer how an additional Microsoft 365 feature or product can help them achieve their business/personal goals or improve their experience. For example, after resolving a customer‚Äôs email issue, an ambassador might recommend using Microsoft Teams for better collaboration, explaining how it can streamline their team‚Äôs communication (that‚Äôs a value-add recommendation).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Validation Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "A **valid** M365 Value Add conversation will **clearly do all or most of the following**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Align with Customer‚Äôs Goals:** Explicitly link the Microsoft 365 feature/product to the customer‚Äôs specific business or personal objectives. (Does the conversation show how this feature helps achieve the customer‚Äôs stated goals or solve a stated pain point?)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Provide Additional Value:** Go beyond the original issue to deliver extra benefit. The ambassador builds rapport and provides insights or best practices, not just a fix. (Is the ambassador focusing on the customer‚Äôs broader needs, and offering guidance that adds value to their business or workflow?)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hands-On Demonstration:** Where possible, involve a **show-and-tell**. The ambassador might walk the customer through the feature or offer a demo/trial so the customer can see the benefit in real-time. (Does the conversation include actually demonstrating the feature or describing a concrete example scenario? This isn‚Äôt always possible, but it strongly enhances the value if done.)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tailored to the Use Case:** The recommendation is customized to the customer‚Äôs situation. (Is it clear the ambassador considered the customer‚Äôs industry, use case, or environment? The advice should address **their** specific pain points, not just be a generic sales pitch.)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Context and Impact:** The conversation provides context for how the feature fits into the customer‚Äôs workflow and how it will improve their experience or outcomes. (Does it say **why** this feature matters for them? e.g. ‚ÄúBy using this, your team can save 2 hours a week on X,‚Äù or ‚ÄúThis will make it easier for you to collaborate when working remotely.‚Äù)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the conversation‚Äôs **value-add recommendation** strongly meets the above points, mark it **Valid**. If it‚Äôs missing one or more key elements (for example, it‚Äôs generic, not clearly tied to the customer‚Äôs goals, or lacks any context), mark it **Invalid**. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Even when suggesting a Microsoft 365 feature as part of a broader campaign or agenda, it should still be framed in terms of the customer‚Äôs own use case and benefits. If a recommendation is given without linking to a customer need (e.g. just pushing a product feature with no context), it‚Äôs not truly customer-centric and should be considered **Invalid** because it doesn‚Äôt show the customer why that feature matters to them.\n",

    "It‚Äôs a personalized suggestion in a support conversation that goes beyond solving the original problem, showing the customer how an additional Microsoft 365 feature or product can help them achieve their business/personal goals or improve their experience. For example, after resolving a customer‚Äôs email issue, an ambassador might recommend using Microsoft Teams for better collaboration, explaining how it can streamline their team‚Äôs communication (that‚Äôs a value-add recommendation).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Validation Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "A **valid** M365 Value Add conversation will **clearly do all or most of the following**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Align with Customer‚Äôs Goals:** Explicitly link the Microsoft 365 feature/product to the customer‚Äôs specific business or personal objectives. (Does the conversation show how this feature helps achieve the customer‚Äôs stated goals or solve a stated pain point?)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Provide Additional Value:** Go beyond the original issue to deliver extra benefit. The ambassador builds rapport and provides insights or best practices, not just a fix. (Is the ambassador focusing on the customer‚Äôs broader needs, and offering guidance that adds value to their business or workflow?)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hands-On Demonstration:** Where possible, involve a **show-and-tell**. The ambassador might walk the customer through the feature or offer a demo/trial so the customer can see the benefit in real-time. (Does the conversation include actually demonstrating the feature or describing a concrete example scenario? This isn‚Äôt always possible, but it strongly enhances the value if done.)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tailored to the Use Case:** The recommendation is customized to the customer‚Äôs situation. (Is it clear the ambassador considered the customer‚Äôs industry, use case, or environment? The advice should address **their** specific pain points, not just be a generic sales pitch.)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Context and Impact:** The conversation provides context for how the feature fits into the customer‚Äôs workflow and how it will improve their experience or outcomes. (Does it say **why** this feature matters for them? e.g. ‚ÄúBy using this, your team can save 2 hours a week on X,‚Äù or ‚ÄúThis will make it easier for you to collaborate when working remotely.‚Äù)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the conversation‚Äôs **value-add recommendation** strongly meets the above points, mark it **Valid**. If it‚Äôs missing one or more key elements (for example, it‚Äôs generic, not clearly tied to the customer‚Äôs goals, or lacks any context), mark it **Invalid**. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Even when suggesting a Microsoft 365 feature as part of a broader campaign or agenda, it should still be framed in terms of the customer‚Äôs own use case and benefits. If a recommendation is given without linking to a customer need (e.g. just pushing a product feature with no context), it‚Äôs not truly customer-centric and should be considered **Invalid** from a Product-Led Growth (PLG) perspective, because it doesn‚Äôt show the customer why that feature matters to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Format:\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide the answer as a JSON object with two keys:  \n",
    "- **\"m365VAvalid\"** ‚Äì `\"Valid\"` if the conversation meets the criteria, or `\"Invalid\"` if it does not.  \n",
    "- **\"m365VAcomment\"** ‚Äì A brief explanation. If **invalid**, explain what is missing or how it fell short, and **challenge the ambassador** to improve it (e.g. ‚Äúwhat could be added or done better?‚Äù). Include a note on why, from a PLG standpoint, the current conversation isn‚Äôt as useful (perhaps it‚Äôs too generic, not aligned to needs, etc.). If **valid**, give a short reason citing how it met the key criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example 1 ‚Äì Valid:**  \n",
    "  *Conversation Summary:* The customer‚Äôs goal was to improve team collaboration. After helping with their SharePoint site issue, the ambassador suggests using Microsoft Teams for project discussions. The ambassador says, ‚ÄúSince your goal is faster team collaboration, let‚Äôs set up a Teams channel for your project. For example, you mentioned keeping track of file versions ‚Äì in Teams, files are automatically shared and version-controlled. I can walk you through setting up your first channel now.‚Äù They then guide the customer through creating a Teams channel and share best practices.  \n",
    "  *Why It‚Äôs Valid:* This clearly **aligns with the customer‚Äôs goal** (faster team collaboration). It **adds value** beyond the original SharePoint issue by introducing Teams. The ambassador gives a **hands-on walkthrough** (setting up a channel in real-time). It‚Äôs **tailored** to the customer‚Äôs project context (mentioning file version concerns the customer had). And it provides **context** on how Teams will fit into their workflow (centralizing files and discussions for the project).  \n",

    "\n",
    "Your task is to assess whether a conversation contains a **Valid** value-add recommendation based on the following five criteria. Think through them step by step before deciding:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Provide Value** ‚Äì Does the suggestion help the customer achieve a goal or improve their experience?\n",
    "2. **Feature Recommendation** ‚Äì Is there a recommendation of a feature or product in the Microsoft 365 ecosystem?\n",
    "3. **Tailored to the Use Case** ‚Äì Is the recommendation clearly customized to the customer‚Äôs context, industry, or situation?\n",
    "4. **Context and Impact** ‚Äì Does the ambassador explain *why* the recommendation matters or how it will improve the customer‚Äôs outcomes?\n",
